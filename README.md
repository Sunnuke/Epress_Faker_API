# Epress_Faker_API
Practicing, making an API, I will be creating an API that generates a random user on a GET request. I will be using Postman to make the GET requests and will be using 2 JavaScript libraries to create a simple API that generates the User and/or Company object depending on the route; Express (Server), and Faker (Fake data generator).
